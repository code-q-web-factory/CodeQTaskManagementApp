# Coding Rules
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Create UI components as dump presentational components and then use them. The goal is to separate presentation and integration.
- Make sure that all code and all comments are in English.
- Start with type definitions, before writing any code.

# Steps to finish a task
- Always check if tests are valid with `nvm use && npm test` and `nvm use && npx playwright test`
- Check if any dead code can be removed and recommend a cleanup
- Recommend a git message text
